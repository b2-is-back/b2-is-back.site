            <h2>B2</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am B2. If you're here from my Discord bio, Iâ€™m going to explain now.</p>
            <p>I disguise myself as other people I create. Not as in celebrities, weird people, or cosplayers; I disguise myself as characters I invent and conceptualize, such as Expo, Bruny, and more.</p>
            <p>Onto Brunys: My Biggest Success

Despite all my lies as Brunys, this isn't a lie: I abandoned being Brunys in 2022. I made an alternate account, B2, where I would troll and joke around, clearly stating that I was Brunys, but nobody believed me. So why not take this to my advantage? Why not expand into alts for nobody to truly know who I am anymore?</p>
